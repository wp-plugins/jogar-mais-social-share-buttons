* Note: My plugin is translatable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide.
So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful.
For translating I recommend the awesome ["Codestyling Localization" plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/)
and for validating the ["Poedit Editor"](http://www.poedit.net/).
